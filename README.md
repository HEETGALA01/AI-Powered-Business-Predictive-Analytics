# AI-Powered-Business-Predictive-Analytics
AI-powered Business Predictive Analytics leverages machine learning and large language models to analyze historical data, identify patterns, and forecast future business trends. It helps organizations make data-driven decisions by predicting outcomes like sales, customer behavior, and market shifts.
An end-to-end data science application that automates data cleaning, exploratory analysis, model selection, and provides AI-powered business insights through an interactive chat interface.

## Key Features

### ðŸ§¹ **Smart Data Cleaning**

- Automatic handling of:
  - Missing values (imputation or removal)
  - Data type conversions
  - High-cardinality columns
  - Irrelevant features
- Detailed cleaning report with before/after comparison

### ðŸ“Š **Automated EDA**
- AI-generated statistical summaries
- Dynamic visualization of:
  - Temporal trends
  - Correlations
  - Distributions
  - Categorical breakdowns
- Custom query system for on-demand visualizations
- Interactive dashboard for all generated charts

### ðŸ¤– **Intelligent Model Selection**
- Context-aware problem detection:
  - Time-series forecasting (LSTM)
  - Regression (XGBoost)
  - Classification (Random Forest)
- Automated feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Business insights from predictions

### ðŸ’¬ **AI Chat Assistant**
- Dataset-aware Q&A (LangChain agents)
- Technical and business question answering
- Conversation memory
- Clear chat functionality
